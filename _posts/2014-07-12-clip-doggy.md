Binder Clips are creative toys, your can use them to build incredible things.
Once I built a dog that can even sit, sniff and stretch!

I'll describe how.

###Basic Ideas
One good thing for Binder Clips is that you can rotate their 'wings' to get different poses, which introduces the moving potential for your final work.

***

A single clip can be modified into 3 forms:

<a href="/images/doggy/clips.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/clips.JPG" width="49%"></a> 

3 kinds of joints can be used to combine clips together. With these patterns, we got movable joints, instead of rigid skeletons:

<table>
<tr align="center">
<td><a href="/images/doggy/joint1.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/joint1.JPG" width="100%"></a></td> 
<td><a href="/images/doggy/joint2.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/joint2.JPG" width="100%"></a></td>
<td><a href="/images/doggy/joint3.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/joint3.JPG" width="100%"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>Joint1</td>
<td>Joint2</td>
<td>Joint3</td>
</tr>
</table>
Joint2 and Joint3 looks similar but with opposite directions.

***

They can also be combined by rigid ways, then they become unmovable but more stable.

<table>
<tr align="center">
<td><a href="/images/doggy/rigid1.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/rigid1.JPG" width="100%"></a></td> 
<td><a href="/images/doggy/rigid2.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/rigid2.JPG" width="100%"></a></td>
<td><a href="/images/doggy/rigid3.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/rigid3.JPG" width="100%"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>Rigid1</td>
<td>Rigid2</td>
<td>Rigid3</td>
</tr>
</table>

Another thing need to mention is that the 'wing' can be removed from a clip.

###The dog
First of all, build the forelegs/backlegs with Joint3/Joint2 respectively. Then apply Rigid1 to each one of them. This increases area contacts to the ground so makes the dog stable.

<tr>
<a href="/images/doggy/10.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/10.JPG" width="49%"></a>
<a href="/images/doggy/20.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/20.JPG" width="49%"></a>
</tr>
***

Combine two forelegs with Rigid2. In the following right picture, 'wings' was removed from the two 'shoulder clips'. As for the linker clip, its 'wing' was rotated to the upper angle and will be the neck.

<tr>
<a href="/images/doggy/30.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/30.JPG" width="49%"></a>
<a href="/images/doggy/40.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/40.JPG" width="49%"></a>
</tr>
***

In a similar way, combine two backlegs with Rigid2. Only this time the linker clip goes below the other two.

***

Clamp two parts togeter:

<tr>
<a href="/images/doggy/60.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/60.JPG" width="49%"></a>
<a href="/images/doggy/70.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/70.JPG" width="49%"></a>
</tr>
***

Add a tail and a neck.

<tr>
<a href="/images/doggy/75.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/75.JPG" width="49%"></a>
<a href="/images/doggy/80.JPG"><img src="/images/doggy/80.JPG" width="49%"></a>
</tr>
***

The final result:
