## Projects:

- Multi-viewpoint Panorama <br/>

  Research for surveillance systems. Our method relaxed the limits for traditional panoramas, achieved state of the art performance on wide-baseline data sets ([see comparison](http://while2.github.io/static/panorama.html)). Mainly implemented with C++, and will be submitted to **TIP(Top Journal on Image Processing)**. I designed, implemented the algorithm, developed related tools(feature editing and seamless composition, etc.), drafted the paper and helped my partner on existed methods for comparison.

- Image/Video Completion <br/>

  A video completion algorithm based on my improvement for [image completion](http://while2.github.io/exemplar-based-completion/), can fill large missing areas in a video clip. I designed a hierarchical approach to significantly improve the performance of Space-Time-Fusion. Implemented in C++, used in a stereo conversion system and a 3d photograph system for object removal. I designed, implemented the algorithm, drafted the **patent** documents and contact with the cooperating company.

- SidMeier's Pirates for Wii <br/>

  At Virtuos Games I worked on a Wii game project, developed Bombarding and Picklock games, the spyglass and the vibration feedback modules.

- Autodesk Inventor 2010 <br/>

  During the internship at Autodesk, I worked in a team with 6 programmers, maintaining the UI framework for Inventor 2010. I fixed bugs and developed a tool to generate Keytips for the newly introduced Ribbon UI.
