__*2012.4 – 2015.3*__ --- M.S in State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China2009.6 – 2010.1 --- Fulltime developer in Virtuos Games, China

2005.9 – 2009.6 --- B.S in Software Engineering, Tongji University, China####Skills:
* Proficient in C/C++, Qt; Knowledgeable in C++11, Python.* Experienced with algorithm design/implementation based on research papers.* Familiar with __computer vision__ and __image processing__.* Good team player, with leadership experience (a 6-students team) in AutodeskChina 2008 Sumer Camp.* Languages: English(working proficiency) and Mandarin(native).####Projects:
* 'his' C++11 Utility Library: [https://github.com/while2/his](https://github.com/while2/his)<br/>A lightweight template library, providing convenience for image manipulation. Used in the following 3 projects.* Wide-baseline Panorama <br/>Research project for surveillance systems. Our method break down the limits for traditional panoramas and achieved state of the art performance on wide-baseline data sets. Mainly implemented with C++, and will be submitted to __TIP__ (Top Journal in Image Processing).* Image/Video Completion <br/>A video completion algorithm based on my improvment of image completion, to fill missing regions in a video clip. I designed a hierarchical approach to significantly improve the performance of Poisson Fusion. Used in our 2d-to-3d system and a 3d photograph system for object removal. Implemented in C/C++. __Patent pending__.* Image-base Rendering <br/>By capturing a video clip, we can provide smooth 3d view experience. We improved the traditional IBR framework by automatically extract and complete the background, and fix the boundary aliasing problem with alpha blend. Implemented in C++. __Patent pending__.* Sid Meier’s Pirates for Wii <br/>At Virtuos Games, I worked on a game project on Nintendo Wii, developed the bombarding, picklock and spyglass module, and a Wii remote vibration feedback system.
