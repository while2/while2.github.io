__*2012.4 – 2015.3*__ --- M.S. in State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China2009.6 – 2010.1 --- Fulltime developer in Virtuos Games, China

2005.9 – 2009.6 --- B.S. in Software Engineering, Tongji University, China####Skills:
* Proficient in __C/C++__, Qt, also capable with C++11, Python.* Experienced with algorithm design/implementation based on research papers.* Familiar with __Computer Vision__ and __Image Processing__.* Good team player, with leadership experience (6-students team) in Autodesk Sumer Camp. (Our team won Innovation & Technology Award.)* Languages: English(working proficiency) and Mandarin(native).####Projects:
* C++11 Template Utility: [https://github.com/while2/his](https://github.com/while2/his)<br/>A lightweight template library, providing convenience for image manipulation. Used in the following projects.
* Multi-viewpoint Panorama <br/>Research project for surveillance systems. Our method break down the limits for traditional panoramas and achieved state of the art performance on wide-baseline data sets. Mainly implemented with C++, and will be submitted to __TIP__ (Top Journal in Image Processing). I designed, implemented the algorithm, developed related tools(feature editing and seamless composition, etc.), wrote the paper and helped my partner on existed methods for comparison.
* Image/Video Completion <br/>A video completion algorithm based on my improvement of image completion, to fill missing regions in a video clip. I designed a hierarchical approach to significantly improve the performance of Poisson Fusion. Implemented in C++, used in a stereo conversion system and a 3d photograph system for object removal. I designed, implemented the algorithm, wrote patent and contact with the cooperating company.
